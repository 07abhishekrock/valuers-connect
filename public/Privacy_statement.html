<p>
    It is VALUERS CONNECT’s general policy not to collect user’s personal information from the website. However, when
    users join VALUERS CONNECT as members, subscribe to VALUERS CONNECT publications, register for educational programs
    or events, or otherwise contact VALUERS CONNECT by e-mail or the website’s designated contact section, in order for
    VALUERS CONNECT to respond, users may be asked to provide personal information from which you can be identified,
    such as your name, date of birth, postal and e-mail address, phone number and credit card information. VALUERS
    CONNECT only collects personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit to VALUERS CONNECT.
</p>
<p>
    When you terminate your membership or VALUERS CONNECT website account access, VALUERS CONNECT may continue to share
    information about you according to our legal and regulatory requirements. We will use the information you provide us
    solely for the purpose of providing you with information that VALUERS CONNECT believes may be of interest to you,
    providing you with information and materials you have requested, administering our relationship with you and for
    internal business purposes such as VALUERS CONNECT research and development projects.
</p>

    third party vendor, provided that all requests are relevant to the interests of VALUERS CONNECT members and
    pre-approved by VALUERS CONNECT. VALUERS CONNECT may also use this information for performing marketing studies,
    research projects, or for other commercial purposes for which it may receive compensation. If VALUERS CONNECT

    personal information with, third parties for their promotional use or for marketing purposes. Third parties refer to
    any entity not within the VALUERS CONNECT organization structure.

    rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request.

    In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a third
    party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third parties concerned or their professional advisors.
    In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by VALUERS CONNECT will be among the assets
    transferred to the buyer.

    transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we

</p>
<h2>European Union Users</h2>
<p>Data protection law in Europe requires a "lawful basis" for collecting and retaining personal information from
    citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include:
</p>
<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply
            with our contractual obligation to deliver the services, enable creators to establish and display their
            projects, and enable backers to find and make pledges to them.</li>
        <li>
            Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data. For example, tax laws require
            us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good
            and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.</li>
        <li>
            We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected
            as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. For
            example, we use identity, device and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the
            services secure. We may also send you promotional communications about our services, subject to your right
            to control whether we do so. We analyze how users interact with our site so we can understand better what
            elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve and
            develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Amendments</h2>
<p>VALUERS CONNECT may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any
    material changes we will update you by means of a notice on this Site prior to the changes taking effect. We
    encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices and this Privacy
    Policy.
